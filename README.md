# Sport Project

This is a Python project to explore sports-related video analysis. The goal is to apply clean software engineering principles while developing a pipeline that can analyze video and extract relevant insights (e.g., detect scoring events).

## Goals

- Practice clean, testable Python code
- Apply tools like Git, GitHub Actions, and unit testing
- Use video or data related to sports for practical experimentation

## Tools & Tech

- Python
- Git & GitHub
- OpenCV (planned)
- PyTest
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Status

Initial setup complete. Project details and milestones to come.
